3. Cross-module integration enhancements should be completed before dashboard improvements
4. All modules must be implemented before standardizing UI/UX
5. UI/UX standardization should be completed before comprehensive testing
6. Comprehensive testing must be completed before deployment preparation
7. All implementation and testing must be complete before finalizing documentation

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All original Streamlit functionality is preserved in the Django/React implementation with 100% verification
2. All modules are fully integrated through the central registry with seamless data sharing
3. Cross-module functionality works flawlessly with consistent UI/UX

8. Documentation is complete, comprehensive, and accessible to all user levels

## Conclusion

This updated final integration plan builds on our comprehensive verification findings to focus on the most critical areas for completion. We have identified specific areas that require further verification, particularly in advanced statistical algorithms, while recognizing the solid foundation already established with fully verified modules like the RAG system and Probability Distributions. By following this plan, we will deliver a cohesive, production-ready platform that preserves all the functionality of the original implementation while providing significant improvements in architecture, performance, and user experience.
