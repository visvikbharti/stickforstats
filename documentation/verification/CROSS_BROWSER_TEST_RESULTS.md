## Issues Summary

| Issue | Browsers Affected | Severity | Status |
|-------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| Slider touch interaction | Mobile Safari, Chrome Android | Medium | To be fixed |
| Chart label overlap | Mobile Safari | Low | To be fixed |
| Animation controls crowding | Chrome Android | Low | To be fixed |
| Animation transition smoothness | Safari | Low | Acceptable |

## Recommendations

1. **Mobile Touch Improvements**
   - Increase touch target size for sliders
   - Add +/- buttons as alternatives to sliders
   - Implement better touch feedback

2. **Responsive Layout Enhancements**
   - Adjust chart layout for mobile screens
   - Reorganize animation controls for smaller screens
   - Test with additional breakpoints

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Investigate Safari animation performance
   - Consider reducing animation complexity on mobile
   - Monitor and optimize chart rendering performance

## Conclusion

The Probability Distributions module performs well across all tested desktop browsers. Mobile experience is good but could benefit from touch interaction improvements and responsive layout refinements. No critical issues were identified that would block deployment. Recommended fixes should be implemented in the next sprint to improve the mobile experience.
