### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `/api/v1/pca-analysis/projects/` | ✅ Complete | CRUD operations for projects |
| `/api/v1/pca-analysis/projects/<id>/` | ✅ Complete | Retrieve detailed project info |
| `/api/v1/pca-analysis/projects/<id>/run_pca/` | ✅ Complete | Run PCA analysis |
| `/api/v1/pca-analysis/projects/<id>/groups/` | ✅ Complete | Manage sample groups |
| `/api/v1/pca-analysis/projects/<id>/samples/` | ✅ Complete | Manage samples |
| `/api/v1/pca-analysis/projects/<id>/genes/` | ✅ Complete | List genes |
| `/api/v1/pca-analysis/projects/create_demo/` | ✅ Complete | Create demo project |
| `/api/v1/pca-analysis/projects/upload_data/` | ✅ Complete | Upload data file |
| `/api/v1/pca-analysis/results/` | ✅ Complete | List PCA results |
| `/api/v1/pca-analysis/results/<id>/` | ✅ Complete | Get result details |
| `/api/v1/pca-analysis/results/<id>/visualization_data/` | ✅ Complete | Get visualization data |

## Fixed Issues

1. **SampleGroupSerializer Description Field Issue**
   - The SampleGroup model did not have a 'description' field but it was referenced in the serializer
   - Fixed by removing the field from the serializer definition

2. **ExpressionValue Project ID Issue**
   - The ExpressionValue objects were being created without the required project_id field
   - Fixed by adding the project reference to the ExpressionValue creation in the data processor service

3. **Missing JSON Fields in PCAResult Model**
   - Added missing JSON fields to the PCAResult model:
     - group_centroids
     - group_distances
     - group_variations
   - These fields are used in the PCA service for storing additional analysis results

4. **Gene Description Field**
   - Added description field to Gene model to match the serializer definition

5. **Default Visualization Creation**
   - Updated default visualization creation to include a name field

## Integration

The PCA Analysis module is fully integrated with the core platform, including:

- User authentication
- Module registry
- Cross-module navigation
- Data sharing with other modules
- Consistent API patterns
- Unified error handling

## Verification Test Results

All basic functionality has been verified with the test script `test_pca_analysis.py`. The script confirms:

1. Authentication works
2. Creating a demo project works
3. Listing projects works
4. Retrieving project details works
5. Listing sample groups works
6. Running PCA analysis works
7. Retrieving results works (when available)
8. Accessing visualization data works

Advanced features currently being validated:

- Gene contribution analysis accuracy
- Group analysis calculations
- Visualization data accuracy
- Large dataset handling

## Remaining Work

1. Comprehensive unit tests for all services
2. Performance optimization for large datasets
3. Advanced visualization options
4. Frontend implementation of all visualization types

## Conclusion

The PCA Analysis module has been successfully migrated from Streamlit to the Django/React architecture. All core functionality has been implemented, and basic verification tests are passing. The module is fully integrated with the core platform and ready for frontend implementation.

Recent fixes have resolved several critical issues related to model fields and serialization. The module now properly handles demo data creation and provides correct API responses for all endpoints.
