            In the Confidence Intervals module of StickForStats, you can calculate various types of confidence intervals:
            
            1. For a population mean:
               - Z-interval (when population standard deviation is known)
               - T-interval (when population standard deviation is unknown)
               
            2. For a population proportion:
               - Wald interval (simple approximation)
               - Wilson score interval (better for small samples)
               - Clopper-Pearson interval (exact method)
               
            3. Advanced methods:
               - Bootstrap confidence intervals for non-normal data
               - Bayesian credible intervals
               
            The module includes interactive visualizations that help you understand how sample size, confidence level, and data variability affect the width of confidence intervals.
