# StickForStats Testing and Debugging Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive approach for thoroughly testing and debugging the StickForStats application after migration from Streamlit to Django/React. This is an updated version based on our implementation progress.

## 1. Unit Testing

### Core Services
- Test `SessionService` methods
  - Session creation/retrieval
  - Analysis result storage/retrieval
  - History management
  - Export functionality

- Test `WorkflowService` methods
  - Workflow creation/retrieval
  - Step dependencies
  - Workflow execution
  - Template management

- Test `AuthService` methods
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - User management

### Statistical Services
- Test all statistical analysis methods
  - Verify calculations against known test cases
  - Compare results to original Streamlit implementation
  - Validate edge cases (empty data, large datasets, etc.)

- Test machine learning services
  - Model training
  - Prediction
  - Cross-validation
  - Model evaluation

- Test visualization services
  - Plot generation
  - Data transformations
  - Serialization/deserialization

## 2. Integration Testing

### API Testing
- Test all REST endpoints
  - Authentication
  - Parameter validation
  - Response format
  - Error handling

- Test WebSocket communication
  - Real-time updates
  - Long-running operations
  - Connection handling

### Cross-Module Integration
- Test data flow between modules
  - Core to specialized modules
  - Between specialized modules
  - Result sharing

- Test workflow execution across modules
  - Multi-step analysis workflows
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Result persistence

## 3. End-to-End Testing

### User Flows
- Data upload and validation
- Basic analysis workflows
- Advanced analysis scenarios
- Report generation and export
- User history and session management

### Cross-Browser Testing
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile responsiveness

## 4. Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- Concurrent user simulation
- Large dataset handling
- Long-running analysis operations

### Memory Usage
- Memory profiling during complex operations
- Memory leak detection

## 5. Comparison Testing

### Result Validation
- Generate parallel analyses in both original and migrated systems
- Compare numerical results (must match precisely)
- Compare visualizations (should be visually equivalent)
- Verify all functionality is preserved

## 6. Debugging Approach

### General Approach
1. Run comprehensive test suite
2. Identify failing tests
3. Analyze logs and error messages
4. Fix issues
5. Re-run tests to verify fixes
6. Document fixes and any design changes

### Common Issues to Look For
- Authentication/authorization failures
- API endpoint routing issues
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) issues
- Data serialization/deserialization problems
- Database query performance issues
- WebSocket connection stability
- React component lifecycle issues
- Statistical calculation precision differences
- Integration points between modules

## 7. Testing Tools

### Backend Testing
- Django TestCase framework
- pytest for more complex test scenarios
- Coverage.py for test coverage analysis

### Frontend Testing
- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Cypress for end-to-end testing

### API Testing
- Postman for manual API testing
- pytest-django for automated API tests

### Performance Testing
- Django Debug Toolbar for performance diagnostics
- React Profiler for component performance
- Locust for load testing

## 8. Testing Environment

### Development Environment
- Local development server
- SQLite database for rapid testing
- In-memory cache

### Staging Environment
- Full PostgreSQL database
- Redis cache
- Docker containerization
- Production-like configuration
