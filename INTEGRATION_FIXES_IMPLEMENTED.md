# StickForStats Integration Fixes - Implementation Report

This document summarizes the integration fixes that have been implemented to address issues in the StickForStats migration project.

## 1. API Configuration and Standardization

### Centralized API Configuration
- Created a centralized API configuration in `frontend/src/config/apiConfig.js`
- Defined standard API endpoints, authentication settings, and WebSocket configuration
- Organized endpoints by module for better maintainability
- Standardized URL patterns across the application

### API Service Implementation
- Created a unified API service in `frontend/src/services/apiService.js`
- Implemented proper token authentication with Bearer format
- Added refresh token handling for expired authentication
- Created standardized error handling and response transformation
- Added specialized methods for file uploads and downloads

## 2. Service-Specific Implementations

### Workflow Service
- Created a dedicated workflow service in `frontend/src/services/workflowService.js`
- Implemented all workflow-related API methods using the centralized API service
- Fixed data format inconsistencies in API request/response handling
- Standardized error handling across all methods

### Report Service
- Created a dedicated report service in `frontend/src/services/reportService.js`
- Implemented proper file download handling with content disposition support
- Fixed parameter inconsistencies between frontend and backend
- Enhanced error handling and reporting

### WebSocket Service
- Created a robust WebSocket service in `frontend/src/services/websocketService.js`
- Implemented exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Added proper authentication handling for WebSocket connections
- Created event-based communication system
- Fixed connection management issues

## 3. React Hook Updates

### useWorkflowAPI Hook
- Updated `useWorkflowAPI.js` to use the new workflow service
- Fixed error handling to use standardized format
- Improved state management for loading and error states
- Made response handling consistent across all methods

### useReportAPI Hook
- Updated `useReportAPI.js` to use the new report service
- Standardized error handling and state management
- Fixed response format inconsistencies

### useWebSocket Hook
- Created an improved WebSocket hook in `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.js`
- Implemented module-specific WebSocket hooks for DOE, PCA, and workflow execution
- Added proper cleanup and reconnection handling
- Fixed state management for WebSocket status

## 4. Backend CORS Configuration

### Enhanced CORS Settings
- Updated CORS configuration in Django settings
- Added explicit CORS allowed methods
- Added explicit CORS allowed headers
- Configured `content-disposition` in exposed headers for file downloads
- Set proper preflight max age for performance

## 5. Testing the Fixes

### Authentication Testing
- Verified token authentication works properly
- Tested token refresh mechanism
- Ensured unauthorized requests are properly handled

### API Communication Testing
- Verified request/response formats match between frontend and backend
- Tested file upload/download functionality
- Verified error handling works as expected

### WebSocket Testing
- Tested WebSocket connection and authentication
- Verified reconnection works with exponential backoff
- Tested real-time updates for workflow execution

## 6. Remaining Issues

While major integration issues have been fixed, some items remain for future implementation:

1. **Global Error Handling**
   - Create a unified error handling service
   - Implement user-friendly error messages
   - Add toast notifications for errors

2. **Pagination Support**
   - Enhance list views to support pagination
   - Implement infinite scrolling where appropriate
   - Add loading indicators for pagination

3. **Frontend Testing**
   - Add comprehensive tests for the new services
   - Create integration tests for frontend-backend communication
   - Update end-to-end tests with the new structure

## 7. Conclusion

The implemented fixes address the critical integration issues identified in the StickForStats migration project. The centralized API configuration and standardized service implementations provide a solid foundation for the application, ensuring robust communication between frontend and backend components.

The WebSocket improvements enhance real-time updates, particularly for long-running operations like workflow execution and analysis processes. The standardized authentication mechanism ensures secure communication across all API endpoints.

These fixes significantly improve the reliability and maintainability of the application, providing a consistent experience for users and a clean architecture for developers.
