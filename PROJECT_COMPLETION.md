## Implementation Highlights

### Module Registry System
A central registry system was implemented to manage module discovery, integration, and dependencies. Modules register themselves with their capabilities, and the system validates and initializes them at startup. This approach provides:

- Loose coupling between modules
- Simplified dependency management
- Runtime discovery of capabilities
- Standardized integration points

### WebSocket Integration
Real-time updates are provided through WebSockets, allowing:

- Progress updates during long-running analyses
- Live visualization updates
- Collaborative features
- Responsive user experience for computationally intensive operations

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System
A comprehensive context-aware guidance system provides:

- Just-in-time assistance based on user actions
- Educational content relevant to current analysis
- Interactive tutorials with conversation history
- References to statistical theory and methodology
- Recommendations for next steps and related analyses
- Document management for knowledge base expansion
- Cross-module integration with context-aware responses
- User feedback collection for continuous improvement
- Intelligent response generation leveraging LLMs with domain-specific context
