## Conclusion

The StickForStats migration project has been successfully completed with all core infrastructure components and specialized modules fully implemented. The migration from Streamlit to Django/React architecture has been accomplished while preserving all original functionality and adding significant improvements in user experience, performance, and maintainability.

All planned modules (Core, RAG System, Confidence Intervals, Probability Distributions, DOE Analysis, PCA Analysis, and SQC Analysis) have been migrated and verified to work together as an integrated platform. The comprehensive integration test script validates that all components interact correctly.

The new architecture provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and extensions. With its modular design, the platform can be easily extended with additional statistical modules while maintaining consistency in user experience and data integration.
